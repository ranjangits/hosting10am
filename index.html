                    <p style=" padding-left: 100px;">my Hobies are that playing games chess ,Chess is a board game
                        played
                        between two players. It is
                        sometimes called Western chess or International chess to distinguish it from related games such
                        as
                        xiangqi and shogi. The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second
                        half of
                        the 15th century after evolving from a similar, much older game of Indian origin The rules of
                        chess
                        (also known as the laws of chess) are rules governing the play of the game of chess. While the
                        exact
                        origins of chess are unclear, modern rules first took form during the Middle Ages. The rules
                        continued to be slightly modified until the early 19th century, when they reached essentially
                        their
                        current form.</p>

                        abbreviated as
                        DBZ) is a Japanese anime television series produced by Toei Animation. Part of the Dragon Ball
                        media
                        franchise, it is the sequel to the 1986 Dragon Ball anime series and adapts the latter 325
                        chapters
                        of the original Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama, which ran in Weekly Shōnen
                        Jump
                        from 1988 to 1995. The series aired in Japan on Fuji TV from April 1989 to January 1996 and was
                        later dubbed for broadcast in at least 81 countries worldwide.[4]

                        Dragon Ball Z continues the adventures of Son Goku in his adult life as he and his companions
                        defend
                        the Earth against villains including aliens (Vegeta, Frieza), androids (Cell), and magical
                        creatures
                        (Majin Buu). At the same time, the story parallels the life of his son, Gohan, as well as the
                        development of his rivals, Piccolo and Vegeta.
